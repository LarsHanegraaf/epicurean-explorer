# Epicurean Explorer
Epicurean Explorer should make you a better party chef, and makes it possible to share your cooking arts with friends.

## Why
I want to build a recipe app that is good looking and easy to use using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Ionic Framework and Capacitor. Just to learn front-end / full-stack development. Let's try do this for 30 days straight.

# Plan
- Setup Next.js application
- Add Tailwind CSS
- Add the Ionic Framework
- Add Capacitor
- Add a DB / ORM
- Host it somewhere
- Setup CI/CD / tests
- Add features
